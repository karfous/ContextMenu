# Context menu project
The project is trying to design context menu using Model View architecture. There will be main DIV element which allows us to create shapes and do some more actions with them.

The architecture was inspired by Backbone framework https://backbonejs.org/

Try to focus on Events module of Backbone which allows different object to listen to events.

See it live on https://codepen.io/karfous/pen/JjBKXdz

## Technology
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JS (pure no framework)

## ToDo
- refresh main view while changing the main collection - the main view does not listen to collection changes 
- review the solution with anybody who has more skills :)
- use modules
- add different shapes types
